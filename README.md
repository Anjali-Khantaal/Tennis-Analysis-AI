# Tennis-Analysis-AI

This project showcases how to develop a tennis analysis system using state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Computer Vision techniques. It features object detection with YOLOv8, object tracking, and key point detection using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Learning Objectives

1. **Object Detection:**
   - Detect players and tennis balls using YOLOv8 from Ultralytics.

2. **Custom Key Point Detection:**
   - Train a CNN in PyTorch to detect court key points for accurate court mapping.

3. **Tracking:**
   - Use object trackers to follow detected objects (players and tennis balls) across frames.

4. **Video Processing:**
   - Utilize OpenCV for reading, processing, and saving video files.

5. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze detection data to create features that give insights into player movements and ball trajectory.
